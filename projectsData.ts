Two illustrations for poems about the way children slip between imagination and reality. One shows a boy still afraid of the tiger under his bed even as his parents head to the theatre.

A three part illustration of Eleven by Sandra Cisneros, focusing on how Rachel’s birthday doesn’t feel as bright as she hoped. The red sweater becomes a creature in her imagination, the gathering at home shows her surrounded yet lonely, and the tiny zero balloon hints at how small she feels. The acrylic technique, limited palette, and rough textures amplify the intensity of her emotions and the way the day overwhelms her.`,
